# Quantified Room: Track Your Environment and Explore Correlations

## Using Arduino and Python

Quantified Room provides a starting point to collect environmental data for personal data analysis.  

The two main objectives are:

1. **IOT Tracking Device**: Build an IOT device to collect rooms conditions (temperature, humiditity, light, noise, air quality, etc.) using an Arduino board (like ESP8266), add various sensors (like DHT11) and store the data either locally or synced to a cloud backend (like ThingSpeak)
2. **Data Analysis**: Provide code to do data discovery and data analysis to explore correlations and compare if environmental conditions have an effect on sleep, productivity, mood, etc.
